    "content": "The Yakuza series is a daunting, enormous game series with a ravenous fanbase. It can be hard to pick up a game and really understand what's going on if you haven't played any of the prior games. Infinite Wealth is likely one of the best games to start with, you might not understand the full depth of all the story points but it jumps in quickly and is extraordinarily fun. The characterization is great, but the game is extraordinarily silly and only occasionally takes itself seriously.",
